# Abid_Final_Project
# Hawaii Wildfire Vulnerability

This project reuses data and code from my thesis on wildfire vulnerability in
Hawaiʻi's Wildland–Urban Interface (WUI).

## Data

- `data/hwra_wui_metrics.csv` – WUI-level metrics exported from my thesis
  analysis. Each row is a WUI; columns include risk score, grass cover, slope,
  ignition density, and island/community identifiers.

## Outputs

Rendered from `final_hwra.qmd`:

1. Summary table of mean WUI metrics by island (gt).
2. Boxplot of wildfire risk score by island.
3. Scatterplot of grass cover vs risk score, colored by island.
4. (Optional) Correlation heatmap of scaled variables.
